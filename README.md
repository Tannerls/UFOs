# UFOs- the truth is out there.

## Overview
This project was to assist Dana with building a webpage with a dynamic table and working filters. Utilizing data provided in a JavaScript data base format I was able to create filters for the app.js file in order to  filter the UFO sightings in a more manageable  output. 


## Results
The following is the results from using app.js to read the UFO data file and apply if statement for filters.

To the lower left of the screen, you are able to filter the data down by typing in your specific request and clicking the filter table button at the bottom. You are able to use any of the filter and any combination together in order to filter the data down.
## Summary
I have assisted Dana with crating a webpage that has a clean layout and is easy to read and filter the data. While the site looks great and utilizes the information provided, it would be a good idea to have the page scraping another site with up to date information. If you are able to provide the most up to date data, the user will be able to better achieve the goal in visiting the website. Also providing more information in the data would be beneficial as well. Maybe adding a column for details of who reported the siting. This would help to validate the information to the reader if they want to look in to who is doing the reporting.
